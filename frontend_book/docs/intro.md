# Physical AI & Robotics: Complete Educational Curriculum

## Welcome to the Ultimate Guide for AI-Driven Humanoid Robotics

This comprehensive educational curriculum provides everything you need to understand and implement AI-driven humanoid robotics systems. Designed for AI students and developers entering humanoid robotics, this book covers the complete pipeline from foundational ROS 2 concepts to advanced AI integration.

## Complete Learning Path Overview

This book is organized into four comprehensive modules that build upon each other to provide a complete understanding of humanoid robotics:

### Module 1: ROS 2 Nervous System
- **Introduction to ROS 2 for Physical AI**: Understand what ROS 2 is, why it matters for humanoids, and DDS concepts
- **ROS 2 Communication Model**: Master Nodes, Topics, Services, and basic rclpy-based agent ↔ controller flow
- **Robot Structure with URDF**: Learn URDF for humanoid robots and simulation readiness

### Module 2: Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)
- **Physics Simulation with Gazebo**: Create realistic physics-based simulations for humanoid robots
- **Digital Twins & HRI in Unity**: High-fidelity digital twins and Human-Robot Interaction using Unity
- **Sensor Simulation & Validation**: Sensor simulation (LiDAR, depth cameras, IMU) and validation techniques

### Module 3: AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)
- **NVIDIA Isaac Sim for Photorealistic Simulation**: Advanced simulation with synthetic data generation
- **Isaac ROS for VSLAM and Navigation**: Accelerated perception, VSLAM, and navigation capabilities
- **Nav2 Path Planning for Humanoid Robots**: Path planning specifically for humanoid robot movement

### Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)
- **Voice Processing with Whisper**: Implement voice-to-action using OpenAI Whisper
- **LLM Cognitive Planning**: Use LLMs for cognitive planning to convert natural language to ROS 2 actions
